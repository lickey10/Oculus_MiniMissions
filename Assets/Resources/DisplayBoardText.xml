      Find the elevator to make it to the next level.  Make sure you avoid security, especially those pesky guards. Jump in the teleporter to your right to get started.

      The laser fences are controlled by terminals. The elevator on this level requires a keycard that you will need to get from the security office. Good Luck!

      They are starting to get tired of the constant infiltration of their security system.  They have installed CCTV cameras.  Watch yourself, they are.
